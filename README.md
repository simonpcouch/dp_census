### Differential Privacy, Race, and the 2020 U.S. Census

Source code and drafts for a final project for SOC 343: Sociology of Race and 
Racism, Reed College (Spring 2020). The project aims to study the racialized 
implications of the U.S. Census Bureau's decision to implement differentially 
private algorithms to privatize population counts for the 2020 U.S. Census.

  - The `src` folder contains source code for downloading `grab_data.R`, 
    tidying `tidy.R`, analyzing `analyze.R`, and visualizing `visualize.R` the 
    data. 
  - While the entire source dataset isn't stored in this repository, a small
    subset, `census_tidy_small.Rda`, as well as some summary datasets (in 
    `/summaries/`), are stored in the `data` folder.
  - The `paper` folder contains TeX code for the final report—the `main.tex`
    file will compile the current paper draft.

The current paper draft is named `Couch_DP_Census_Racism_2020.pdf`.
