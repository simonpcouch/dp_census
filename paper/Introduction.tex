\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

In Summer 2018, the U.S. Census Bureau (``the Bureau'') announced that it would be making use of an emerging class of privatization techniques, differentially private algorithms, in order to protect the results of the 2018 End-to-End Census Test, and later, the 2020 Decennial Census. This decision followed internal research showing that the Bureau's current techniques to protect respondent privacy were no longer sufficient. In order to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, the Census publicly released the results of a ``trial run'' on the already publicly available 2010 data. These data show that the implementation of these algorithms will have a disproportionately negative impact on populations of color, exacerbating the continuing historical problem of the Bureau systematically undercounting this segment of the population.
